# dron-prototype
This is still an unfinished project of a dron in the management of Wi-Fi. The base for the drone is stm32f407vg, wi-fi - esp-201, the control program is written in C# Xamarin.

For orientation, use the MPU-9050 and Madgwick's filter.

TODO list:
1. TCP does not work in the client at the reception.
2. Pressing the buttons in the client lights the LEDs, because engines are not yet on hand.
3. No stabilization function.

Most likely the project will never be completed
